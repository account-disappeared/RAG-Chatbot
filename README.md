| `/upload-doc` | Use Choma DB and a specified embeddings model in `chroma_utils.py` to automatically split and index the uploaded document. Support `.docx` `.pdf` and `.txt`. |
| `/list-docs`  | List the documents embedded in Chroma DB. When initialized, a folder named `chroma_db` should be created.                                                     |
| `/delete-doc` | Delete the chosen document from Chroma |                                                                                                                       |
