|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/chat`       | Use the model and chain specified in `langchain_utils.py` to chat. It preserves chat history based on the session ID generated.                               |
| `/upload-doc` | Use Choma DB and a specified embeddings model in `chroma_utils.py` to automatically split and index the uploaded document. Support `.docx` `.pdf` and `.txt`. |
| `/list-docs`  | List the documents embedded in Chroma DB. When initialized, a folder named `chroma_db` should be created.                                                     |
| `/delete-doc` | Delete the chosen document from Chroma |                                                                                                                       |

      Moreover, Blondin's achievements tapped into a fundamental human fascination with risk and the limits of human capability. We are drawn to those who push          boundaries, who venture into the realm of the seemingly impossible. Blondin embodied this spirit of exploration, not of geographical frontiers, but of the         frontiers of human skill and nerve. His walks across the Niagara were a powerful demonstration of what dedication, training, and an indomitable will could         achieve. In a world that often feels constrained by limitations, Blondin offered a thrilling glimpse of human potential unleashed.
      Finally, Blondin's legacy has been carefully preserved and romanticized through history. Stories of his daring feats have been passed down, often                  embellished, contributing to his almost mythical status. He represents a bygone era of grand spectacle and individual heroism, a time when a single person         could capture the world's imagination with a breathtaking display of skill and courage.
